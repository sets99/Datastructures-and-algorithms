I work under a Duke professor (Dr. Fan Wei) for math research, and on November 13th I had a Zoom meeting with her in which I had to explain my findings (Note - I did not travel to Duke, I was in my dorm. I have attached a screenshot of an email communication with my mentor as proof of this), but this clashed with my forum time which is from 5pm-6pm. So, I emailed Dr. Slinker long before and he said it was okay if I miss the forum on the 13th. However, later, he said that regardless, he had to mark it as an absence since I wasn't there and that I'd have to fill out this form in order to get it excused. Proof of this is also attached.
